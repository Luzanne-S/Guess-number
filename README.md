# Guess The Number

Is a number guessing game. The browser randomly sets a number that the user must guess.
The user then types in a number, and the browser will either confirm the correct number and the user get the highest possible score.
If not then the user is informed that the number typed in is either too high or too low.
If the user then guesses correctly then they win but points are deducted everytime the user inputs an incorrect number.
If the user's score drops below 0 then the user loses and can try again .
